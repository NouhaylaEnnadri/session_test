			<h1>Welcome to our website!</h1>
			<p>Here's a sad poem about sorrow and loss:</p>
			<p>Lost in a world of darkness,
			No hope to find the light,
			Sorrow takes hold of my heart,
			And never lets me go.
			Memories of days gone by,
			Fill my mind with regret,
			And I am left to wonder,
			What might have been,
			If only I had known.
			So I walk this lonely road,
			Through the valley of despair,
			With nothing left to hold on to,
			But the hope of a brighter tomorrow,
			And the memories of a yesterday,
			That I can never reclaim.</p>
